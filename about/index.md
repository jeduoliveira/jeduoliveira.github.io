### Who am I?



### Java developer
I started learning Java in 2003 at a Lato Sensu Class. It was a first love sensation. After that I have been studying and trying to use Java as a powered, scalable and productive solution. As a result from this love I took certifications below:

- 2003 – SCJP - Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platfor

### The early days


### The Linux days



### The enterprise days


My current interests are:

- Cloud-native applications
- Containers (Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift) 
- Microservices
- Service Mesh
- Serverless
- Object Oriented / Functional Programming
- Javascript (AngularJS and NodeJS)
- DevOps tools and practices
- Agile Methodologies
- Opensource

That’s all.

Thank you for reading. And I hope to see you again.
